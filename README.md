How It Works

1. User Interaction:

The player clicks a button to select Rock, Paper, or Scissors.



2. Computer Selection:

The computer randomly generates its choice.



3. Game Logic:

Compare the userâ€™s choice with the computerâ€™s choice:

Tie if both choices are the same.

The user wins if their choice beats the computerâ€™s.

The computer wins otherwise.




4. Score Update:

Scores are updated after each round.



5. Game Over:

After 10 rounds, the game announces the final winner.

A 10-second countdown refreshes the page for a new session.
